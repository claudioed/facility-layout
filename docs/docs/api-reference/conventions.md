# API conventions

This service was built to **Richardson maturity level 2** and **RFC 7807**
from the first commit, rather than migrating to them later as the four
sibling services did historically.

## Resource nouns, correct verbs

Every path is a resource collection or a member of one. Two verb-suffixed
action endpoints exist and both are deliberate:

- **`POST /locations/{locationCode}/decommission`** — a genuine domain
  command on a single slot, not a CRUD update. Forcing it into
  `PATCH {"status":"Decommissioned"}` would misrepresent a one-way state
  transition as a field assignment.
- **`POST /locations/import`** — a collection-level action scoped to the
  `/locations` resource, rather than dangling off an unscoped `/admin/...`
  path.

No unscoped RPC-style endpoint exists in this service.

## Every `201` carries a resolvable `Location`

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /zones/WH1-STOR-AMB
```

Four single-resource `GET`s exist specifically so that every `Location`
header points at something that actually has a representation:

| Endpoint | Exists so that this `Location` resolves |
|---|---|
| `GET /zones/{zoneId}` | `POST /sites/{siteCode}/zones` |
| `GET /zones/{zoneId}/aisles/{aisleCode}` | `POST /zones/{zoneId}/aisles` |
| `GET /location-types/{name}` | `POST /location-types` |
| `GET /placement-rules/{ruleId}` | `POST /placement-rules` |

A `Location` with no `GET` behind it is not maturity level 2.

## Status codes

| Code | When |
|---|---|
| `200` | Successful read, or a bulk-import report |
| `201` | Resource created — always with `Location` |
| `204` | Successful action with no body (decommission) |
| `400` | Malformed input: bad JSON, a location code that is not seven `[A-Z0-9]` segments, a missing required identifier |
| `404` | The named site/zone/aisle/slot/type/rule does not exist |
| `409` | State conflict: a code already taken, a parent that exists but is not Active, a slot already decommissioned |
| `422` | Semantically invalid: non-positive capacity, unknown enum value, **PlacementRule violation** |

The 409/422 split is the one worth internalising:

- **409** means *the world is in a state that forbids this* — the code is
  taken, or the parent zone has been decommissioned. Retrying the identical
  request will keep failing until something else changes.
- **422** means *this request is internally wrong* — a negative capacity, an
  unknown temperature class, a location type that is not legal in that zone.
  The caller has to change the request.

`POST /locations/import` answers **`200`**, not `201`: a bulk import is a
partial-success report over many rows, not the creation of one addressable
resource, so there is no single `Location` to hand back.

## RFC 7807 problem details

Every error response — from the first commit, with no bespoke
`{"error": "..."}` predecessor — is
`Content-Type: application/problem+json`:

```json
{
  "type": "https://errors.facility-layout.warehouse-systems.dev/site-not-found",
  "title": "Site not found",
  "status": 404,
  "detail": "site not found",
  "instance": "/sites/NOPE"
}
```

| Member | Meaning here |
|---|---|
| `type` | A stable URI identifying the error **category**. One per distinct category; it is an identifier, not a page that has to resolve. |
| `title` | A fixed human string for the category. Never varies for a given `type`. |
| `status` | Mirrors the HTTP status code. |
| `detail` | The dynamic, request-specific message — this is where the violated rule gets named. |
| `instance` | The request path. |

The mapping is a single table in the HTTP adapter
(`internal/adapters/inbound/http/errors.go`) keyed off typed domain errors
with `errors.Is`. The domain never knows an HTTP status code exists.

### The problem type catalogue

| `type` slug | Status | Title |

| `internal-error` | 500 | An unexpected internal error occurred |

All `type` values are prefixed with
`https://errors.facility-layout.warehouse-systems.dev/`.

## Two worked errors

Unknown site:

```bash
curl -i localhost:8080/sites/NOPE
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: application/problem+json

{"type":"https://errors.facility-layout.warehouse-systems.dev/site-not-found","title":"Site not found","status":404,"detail":"site not found","instance":"/sites/NOPE"}
```

Duplicate location code:

```bash
curl -i -X POST localhost:8080/locations -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"locationCode":"WH1-STOR-AMB-A07-03-02-B","locationType":"PalletRack"}'
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict
Content-Type: application/problem+json

{"type":"https://errors.facility-layout.warehouse-systems.dev/duplicate-location-code","title":"A location slot with this code already exists","status":409,"detail":"a location slot with this code already exists","instance":"/locations"}
```

## DTOs never leak domain structs

Request and response bodies are defined in the HTTP adapter
(`internal/adapters/inbound/http/dto.go`) and mapped explicitly. No domain
aggregate is serialized directly — the aggregates have unexported fields, so
it is not even possible by accident.

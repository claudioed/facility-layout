# facility-layout documentation site

The documentation site for the **Facility Layout** bounded context, published
to <https://claudioed.github.io/facility-layout/>.

## Local development

```sh
npm ci
npm start          # dev server on http://localhost:3000/facility-layout/
```

## Build

```sh
npm run build      # static output in ./build; fails on broken internal links
npm run serve      # serve the built output locally
npm run typecheck  # tsc
```

## Regenerating the API reference

The pages under `docs/api-reference/rest/` are **generated** from this
repository's real specification at `../apis/openapi.yaml`. `npm run build`
regenerates them automatically; to do it by hand:

```sh
npm run gen-api-docs     # regenerate from ../apis/openapi.yaml
npm run clean-api-docs   # remove the generated output
```

Do not hand-edit anything under `docs/api-reference/rest/` — edit
`apis/openapi.yaml` at the repository root instead.

# REST API and frontend contract

## REST API (inbound adapter) — this is the "draw the warehouse" capability

Structural / write side (builds up the model):

- `POST   /sites`                                    -> RegisterSite
- `GET    /sites`                                    -> list sites
- `GET    /sites/{siteCode}`                          -> get one site
- `POST   /sites/{siteCode}/zones`                    -> RegisterZone
- `GET    /sites/{siteCode}/zones`                    -> list a site's zones
- `POST   /zones/{zoneId}/aisles`                     -> RegisterAisle
- `GET    /zones/{zoneId}/aisles`                     -> list a zone's aisles
- `POST   /location-types`                            -> RegisterLocationType
- `GET    /location-types`                            -> list location types
- `POST   /placement-rules`                           -> DefinePlacementRule
- `GET    /placement-rules`                           -> list placement rules
- `POST   /locations`                                 -> RegisterLocationSlot
- `GET    /locations/{locationCode}`                  -> get one slot
- `GET    /locations/{locationCode}/classification`   -> Zone Hazmat/TemperatureClass
  (denormalized read; Published Language for placement-rule consumers like
  `inventory-storage` — see ADR-0008)
- `POST   /locations/{locationCode}/decommission`     -> DecommissionLocationSlot
- `POST   /locations/import`                          -> ImportFacilityLayout
  (bulk; request body is a JSON array of rows, each row fully specifying a
  site/area/zone/aisle/bay/level/position + locationType — the WHOLE point
  of this endpoint is that a real warehouse's layout gets loaded here once,
  reproducibly, not typed in by hand slot-by-slot)

Read / "draw" side (the deliverable this service exists for — REST APIs
whose PURPOSE is to render the warehouse, not just CRUD):

- `GET  /sites/{siteCode}/layout`
  Returns the FULL nested structure for one site: zones -> aisles ->
  location slots, with every slot's coordinates, type, status. Shaped so a
  frontend can directly render a floor plan (group by zone, then aisle,
  then bay/level/position) without further client-side joining. The
  primary "draw the warehouse" endpoint.
- `GET  /zones/{zoneId}/grid`
  Returns ONE zone's slots as an explicit 2D grid: rows = Level, columns =
  (Aisle, Bay) pairs in aisle `SequenceHint` order, cell = slot
  status/type (or null for a gap). A UI can iterate over this directly and
  paint it as a warehouse map — no client-side layout math required.
- `GET  /sites/{siteCode}/layout?format=svg`
  STRETCH scope: same data as the JSON layout endpoint, rendered
  server-side as a minimal SVG floor plan (one colored rect per zone, one
  row of rects per aisle, color = zone temperature class / hazmat flag).
  Must be valid, viewable SVG (`<svg>...</svg>`,
  `Content-Type: image/svg+xml`). Keep it a thin adapter-only concern
  (render function in the HTTP layer only) — do NOT let SVG rendering leak
  into domain or application layers.
- `GET  /healthz`

## CORS

`go-chi/cors` middleware is enabled on every route, allowing
`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (env, default
`http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:5186` — the `warehouse-console`
shell and this service's own `facility-mfe` remote). This service is not
part of the fleet's cross-service Order Lifecycle read model (see ADR-0002
in `warehouse-ops-agent`'s docs) — no order-lifecycle stage touches
facility structure — CORS here exists solely for `facility-mfe`.

## Frontend micro-frontend remote (`web/`)

This repo owns `web/`: `facility-mfe`, a Vite + React Module Federation
**remote** consumed by the separate `warehouse-console` shell repo. It is
a plain browser client of this service's own REST API above (site list,
drill into a site's nested zone/aisle/slot layout) — nothing in `web/`
talks to any other bounded context, and nothing in `internal/` knows
`web/` exists. `web/` has its own `package.json`, build, and dev server
(`:5186`); it does not participate in this repo's Go quality gate and is
not part of the Go module.

JSON DTOs live in the http adapter; never leak domain structs. Follow the
SAME REST maturity level (Richardson Level 2) and RFC 7807
(`application/problem+json`) error format the other four services already
use — replicate it exactly (resource nouns, correct verbs/status codes,
`Location` header on every 201, RFC 7807 problem details on every error).

## Auth status

There is currently **no auth layer** on REST or MCP endpoints (ADR-0014
introduced static-bearer auth; ADR-0015 fully reverted it, commit
`73d6068`, 2026-09-09). Do not assume `AUTH_MODE`/`API_READ_KEY`/
`API_READWRITE_KEY` env vars exist — they were removed. Re-adding auth
requires re-reading ADR-0015 first.

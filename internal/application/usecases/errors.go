// Package usecases implements the application's use cases: one struct per
// use case, depending only on the domain and on application/ports. The
// orchestration this bounded context actually owns lives here — resolving
// the Site -> Zone -> Aisle chain of custody before a LocationSlot is
// allowed to exist, and assembling the drawable read models.

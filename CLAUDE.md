# Project: Facility Layout (Generic Subdomain — physical warehouse structure)

The system of record for **where things physically are in the building**:
the site's structural hierarchy (site, area, zone, aisle) and the coded
storage slots inside it. This context does NOT own occupancy or stock —
that stays in `inventory-storage`'s `Bin`/`StockUnit` aggregates. It owns
whether a coded location **exists, is active, and is legal for a given kind
of storage unit** — the "warehouse map" that other contexts read but never
write.

Source of truth for the domain model: `/Users/claudioed/docs/amazon-fulfillment-ddd.md`
and `/Users/claudioed/warehouse-systems-ddd.md`. Honor that ubiquitous
language everywhere in this codebase.

This file is a concise index. Detailed reference material lives under
`.claude/rules/` (see the map at the bottom) — read the relevant rule file
before touching that area of the code.

## Project Overview

- **Module**: `github.com/claudioed/facility-layout`, Go 1.26.
- **Strategic classification**: Generic Subdomain (same bucket as
  Cartonization/WCS in `warehouse-systems-ddd.md`) — well-understood, not a
  competitive differentiator, and explicitly a concern the domain doc says
  to *extract rather than duplicate*. `inventory-storage` (WMS tier) needs
  location validity to accept a stow; `wes-work-planning` /
  `fulfillment-execution` (WES tier) need zone/aisle adjacency for
  travel-path and congestion reasoning. Neither owns it; both consume it —
  that's why this is its own bounded context and its own service, never a
  package bolted onto `inventory-storage`.
- **Relationship to the rest of the system**: this service is an **Open
  Host Service** with a **Published Language** (its domain events). It has
  NO inbound dependency on any of the other four fleet services and never
  will — `inventory-storage`, `wes-work-planning`, `workforce-management`,
  `fulfillment-execution` are all downstream **Conformists**. This service
  never reaches into their aggregates, and none of them get write access to
  this one's.
- **Full ubiquitous language, aggregate invariants, domain events, and use
  cases**: `.claude/rules/domain-model.md`.

## Architecture (NON-NEGOTIABLE — identical shape across the fleet)

Hexagonal / Ports & Adapters. Strict dependency rule: **domain depends on
nothing; application depends on domain; adapters depend on
application/domain.** No framework or SQL types in the domain layer.

## Integration publishing & analytics data product (ADR-0009, ADR-0010)

This is an **Open Host Service**: its domain events are its Published
Language.

- **Integration (ADR-0009)**: `outbound/kafka` publishes every domain event
  to `warehouse.facility.events` when `EVENT_PUBLISHER=kafka`. Default
  (unset) uses the `outbound/events` log/outbox publisher. No OTel package
  on this publisher — it is trace-free by design.
- **Analytics (ADR-0010)**: additive read side built from this service's
  OWN events. OLTP domain/application must NOT import the analytics store
  (enforced by `internal/architecture` arch-tests); `internal/analytics/report/`
  depends on nothing. A second kafka adapter publishes to
  `warehouse.facility.analytics`. Separate `ANALYTICS_DATABASE_URL`,
  `migrations/analytics/`, read-only reader role. Three processes:
  `cmd/facility` (OLTP), `cmd/facility-projector` (only analytics writer,
  consumes from FirstOffset, idempotent on `event_id`), `cmd/facility-reports`
  (read-only, `GET /reports/...`); an MCP report tool exposes the same data.
- **Report**: **Layout Catalog Growth & Change**, per site/zone × DAY
  bucket. `GET /reports/.../freshness` reports lag.
- **Auth status (ADR-0014, reverted by ADR-0015)**: REST/MCP static-bearer
  auth was added then fully reverted (commit `73d6068`, 2026-09-09) — there
  is currently NO auth layer on REST or MCP endpoints. Do not re-add
  `AUTH_MODE`/`API_READ_KEY`/etc. without re-reading ADR-0015 first.

## Key Commands

Local quality gate — run these from the repo root, not the docs site:

```
make check       # fmt-check + vet + build + lint + test — run before every commit
make check-all   # check + coverage(90%) + arch-test + bdd — run before every push
make coverage    # unit coverage gate, identical to the CI test job
make integration # build-tagged Postgres integration tests — needs DATABASE_URL
make vuln        # govulncheck ./... — run after touching go.mod/go.sum
make mutation    # gremlins on internal/domain — run after changing domain behaviour
```

Docs site (Docusaurus, OpenAPI-generated reference):

```
cd docs
npm ci
npm run gen-api-docs   # regenerate docs/docs/api-reference/rest/* from apis/openapi.yaml
npm run build          # runs gen-api-docs all, then docusaurus build
npm start               # local dev server
```

`.golangci.yml` is copied VERBATIM from `../inventory-storage/.golangci.yml`
— do not hand-edit; re-copy if the fleet's shared config changes.

## Code Standards

- Go 1.26, modules. chi (`github.com/go-chi/chi/v5`), pgx/v5 + pgxpool,
  golang-migrate SQL migrations.
- Config via env: `DATABASE_URL`, `HTTP_ADDR` (default `:8080`),
  `ANALYTICS_DATABASE_URL`, `EVENT_PUBLISHER` (`kafka` or unset).
- Typed domain errors mapped to HTTP status in the adapter; RFC 7807
  `application/problem+json` for every error response (ADR-0004) — do not
  invent a bespoke `{"error": ...}` shape.
- Table-driven tests: domain + application (in-memory adapter); one
  httptest per endpoint; build-tagged Postgres integration test (skipped
  without `DATABASE_URL`).
- gofmt/go vet clean; every package has a doc comment.
- `web/` (the `facility-mfe` frontend) has its own `package.json`/build/dev
  server and is NOT part of the Go module or its quality gate.

  convention, and the 10 application-layer use cases.
- **`rest-api-and-frontend.md`** — the complete REST endpoint table (write

  CORS policy, and the `web/` facility-mfe module-federation contract.
